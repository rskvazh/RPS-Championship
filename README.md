# RPS-Championship (VR Hand Tracking Game)

Rock-Paper-Scissors VR game for **Oculus Quest** with Hand Tracking support by https://xocus.co

Classic Rock Paper Scissors game with a new level of immersion. Use **Hand Tracking** feature to play with your hand just like in real life.

The application is under development, so there may be bugs in it, and hand tracking may not work perfectly. So far you can only play with your right hand. If you know what I mean ;)
